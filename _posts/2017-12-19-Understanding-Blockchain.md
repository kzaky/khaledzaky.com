*NOTE: I'm not a financial or legal advisor. I just have a passion for software technologies and believe in Blockchain's future. I don't recommend you putting all your life savings in [Bitcoin](http://khaledzaky.com/blockchain/2017/12/10/What-is-Bitcoin/) or any other cryptocurrency.*

## The New Internet
By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised for the digital currency, [Bitcoin](http://khaledzaky.com/blockchain/2017/12/10/What-is-Bitcoin/), the tech community is now finding other potential uses for the technology.

## Digital Gold
[Bitcoin](http://khaledzaky.com/blockchain/2017/12/10/What-is-Bitcoin/) has been called “digital gold,”. [The total value of the currency](http://khaledzaky.com/blockchain/2017/12/17/Top-10-Crytpos/) is close to $9 billion US. And blockchains can make other types of digital value. Check out my post on [Top 10 Cryptos](http://khaledzaky.com/blockchain/2017/12/17/Top-10-Crytpos/) which illustrates the market capitalization of the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

>“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.” [Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)](http://dontapscott.com/books/blockchain-revolution/)

## Real Value
The blockchain network lives in a state of consensus, one that automatically checks in with itself every ten minutes. A kind of self-auditing ecosystem of a digital value, the network reconciles every transaction that happens in ten-minute intervals. Each group of these transactions is referred to as a “block”. It is also like the internet in that it has a built-in robustness. By storing blocks of information that are identical across its network, the blockchain cannot:

* Be controlled by any single entity.
* Has no single point of failure.
* Transparency data is embedded within the network, by definition it is public.
* It cannot be corrupted altering any unit of information on the blockchain would mean using a huge amount of computing power to override the entire network.

## Blockchain Simplified
Put simply, a blockchain is a ledger of records organized in ‘blocks’ that are linked together by cryptographic validation. It is a digital storage of consensus truth. The key is to understand that this ledger is neither stored in a centralized location nor managed by any single entity, hence its distributed-ness. The block validation system results in new transactions being added irreversibly and old transactions preserved forever for all to see, hence its transparency and resilience. Open-source software that leverage on the blockchain technology are called Dapps or Decentralized Applications.
