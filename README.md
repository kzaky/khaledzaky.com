## khaledzaky.com

My personal website/blog based on Jekyll.

## Before You Begin

In the _config.yml file, the base URL is set to my personal website. It's recommended that you remove the base URL before working with this theme locally!

It should look like this:
`baseurl: ""`

## What's Included

A full Jekyll environment is included with this website. 

To test locally:

1. Clone repo locally
2. cd into the directory
3. Write the following `bundle install`
4. Run `jekyll serve` in your terminal
5. Preview the build in your browser `localhost:4000`
6. You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.
